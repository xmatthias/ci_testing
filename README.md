# CI testing repository

This repository is a minimal test repository for running interactive CI runners.

It is intentionally small and contains no production code — use it to experiment
with CI workflows, runner interactions, and debugging CI configuration.

Clone or push changes to trigger your CI and use this repo as a safe sandbox.
